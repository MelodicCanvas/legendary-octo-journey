I honestly could not tell you the difference, all I know is that the top one works fine in GoDot and the bottom one there is weird problems with the H and V frames.

# Music
The only thing to keep in mind for the music is that it need to be in .ogg format not .mp3

# Code
Since I started the project I'm going to be coding in my own style with my own styling.\
For example functions should take on PascalCase. 
```
void PascalCase() {
  return;
}
```
\
And then variables should take on camelCase
```
var movementSpeed = 100;
```
Any more conventions you can just follow the codebase or if you want to do your own styling just tell me and we can talk about it.
